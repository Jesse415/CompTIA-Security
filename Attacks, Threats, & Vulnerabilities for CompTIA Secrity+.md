# Attacks, Threats, & Vulnerabilities for CompTIA Security+

### Comparing Different types of social engineering techniques
* A social engineer is someone who is a master of asking seemingly non-invasive questions to gather information over time
        
    * Gain trust to reduce defenses 
    * Can be combined with different techniques to gather information
    * Example: Calling customer service and acting like someone from corporate asking names of apps, or infrastructure, and/or buzz words. Then calling back and talking with said buzz words to pretend to be in the company to get more and more information. 
* Phishing
  * Obtaining sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card info)
  * Tricking a user into entering their info into a fake website
    * Email spoofing
    * Instant messaging
    * SMS (Smishing)
  * Pretend to be social media websites, auction sites, or communication from friends or colleagues
* Types of Phishing
  * Like phishing, expect the target is well researched and appears to come from a trusted sender
* Whaling 
  * Phish campaigns that target the "big fish" within an organizations, for things like wire transfers, tax information and other financial data
* Smishing
  * Phishing attacks carried over SMS
* Vishing
  * Social engineering techniques designed to get the victim to divulge personal or sensitive information
  * Attacker poses as a legitimate company, repair person, security personnel or someone of trust
    * Can come from internal or external to the company
* SPAM
  * Sending out large quantities of unsolicited emails
    *  Typically for commercial advertising
    *  Can also be used via social media, texts/IM, video and VoIP spam
  * SPAM over Instant Messaging (SPIM)
    * Can be more effective as the interactions can occur in real-time
* Dumpster Diving
  * An attacker can go into a companies dumpster to look for sensitive information
  * Username/passwords
  * Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    * Mitigation - Shredding documents prior to disposal
* shoulder Surfing
  * Social engineering trick to get someone to enter credentials into an application or website
    * Strike up a conversation about their kid's sports, then ask to see some photos
    * Shoulder surf as they enter their username/password into social media website
      * Mitigation 
        * Privacy screens

    * Emails are targeted, very specific and seem legitimate
  * Mitigation

      * Ensure employees know to never click links from sources they don't know
      * Don't open attachments from an unknown origin
    * Technical Controls
      * SPAM filtering 
      * Heuristics
      * Firewalls/Deep Packet Inspections
* Prepending
  * Adding mentions (@username) to tweets or social media posts to make them seem more personal
    * Higher engagement
    * Can be automated to become almost as efficient as manual spear-phishing campaigns

  * Impersonation can be done via a number of methods:
  * Social engineering 
  * Stolen credentials/credential harvesting
  * Infiltrating a network and capturing and replaying packets on a network
* Identity Fraud

    * Paste sites allow hackers and bad actors to post large amount of comprised accounts and information, as well as access other breach information
* Watering Hole Attack
  * Sophisticated attack that identifies less secure websites users in a particular company or organization are likely to visit
    * Attackers plant malware on the sites users visit to then infect the targeted users - once they visit the infected site
    * Malicious code scans the users' computer for vulnerabilities, zero-days, etc.
      * May download additional code to initiate attacks, siphon data, etc.

### Analyzing Malware and Other Attacks
* Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
  * Artifacts observed that indicate (with a high degree of confidence) a computer intrusion
    * Some Potential Indicators of Compromise
      * Unusual outbound network traffic
      * DNS request anomalies
      * Mismatch port-application traffic
      * Anomalies in privileged user account activity
* Virus
  * Malicious code that requires user interaction to install and replicate
* Cryto-malware/Ransomware
  * Malicious application that scare or scam users into taking some type of action
    * Typically paying the creator for removal of the ransomware/decryption of files
* Trojan
  * Seemingly friendly software that contains hidden malicious software
* Worms
  * Self-replicating program that is usually self contained and can execute and spread without user interaction
  * Two main types of worms
    * Network Service Worms
      * Exploits network vulnerability to propagate and infect others
    * Mass Mailing Worms
      * Exploits email systems to spread and infect others
* Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)
  * Applications that are typically downloaded as part of another program (adware, or spyware)d
* File-less Virus
  * Malware that operates in memory
    * Not stored in a file nor installed on a victim's machine
    * Typically hooks into a Windows PC via Powershell or WMI
    * 2017 Ponemon Institute study estimates that 77 percent of detected attacks were file-less
  * File-less/attack frameworks examples
    * Empire
    * PowerSploit
    * MetaSploit
    * CobaltStrike
  * Enables file-less malware creation and Powershell post-exploit framework
* Botnets
  * Malicious code that infects large numbers of hosts for the purpose of launching large scale attacks on specific targets
  * Attacker can be located anywhere in the world
  * Control one or more Command and Control (C&C) Servers
  * C&C servers can control thousands of bots (Zombies) for massive DDoS attacks
* Logic Bomb
  * Malicious code that triggers after a period of time based on some date or specific activity
* Spyware
  * Malicious software that captures user activity and reports back (keystrokes, website visits, etc.)
* Keylogger
  * Malicious application that once installed on a host can capture all keystrokes 
    * Usernames/Passwords
    * Sensitive Information
    * Emails/ chats/ instant messages
  * Captured files can be uploaded to a remote location, emailed, or stored locally for later retrieval
* Rootkits
  * Malicious code that installs itself at the OS or kernel level to avoid detection
  * Rootkits are very difficult to get rid of
    * Load before the OS loads
    * Can disable anti-virus and anti-malware
