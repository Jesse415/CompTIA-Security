# Attacks, Threats, & Vulnerabilities for CompTIA Security+

### Comparing Different types of social engineering techniques
* A social engineer is someone who is a master of asking seemingly non-invasive questions to gather information over time
        
    * Gain trust to reduce defenses 
    * Can be combined with different techniques to gather information
    * Example: Calling customer service and acting like someone from corporate asking names of apps, or infrastructure, and/or buzz words. Then calling back and talking with said buzz words to pretend to be in the company to get more and more information. 
* Phishing
  * Obtaining sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card info)
  * Tricking a user into entering their info into a fake website
    * Email spoofing
    * Instant messaging
    * SMS (Smishing)
  * Pretend to be social media websites, auction sites, or communication from friends or colleagues
* Types of Phishing
  * Like phishing, expect the target is well researched and appears to come from a trusted sender
* Whaling 
  * Phish campaigns that target the "big fish" within an organizations, for things like wire transfers, tax information and other financial data
* Smishing
  * Phishing attacks carried over SMS
* Vishing
  * Social engineering techniques designed to get the victim to divulge personal or sensitive information
  * Attacker poses as a legitimate company, repair person, security personnel or someone of trust
    * Can come from internal or external to the company
* SPAM
  * Sending out large quantities of unsolicited emails
    *  Typically for commercial advertising
    *  Can also be used via social media, texts/IM, video and VoIP spam

    * Can be more effective as the interactions can occur in real-time
* Dumpster Diving
  * An attacker can go into a companies dumpster to look for sensitive information
  * Username/passwords
  * Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
    * Mitigation - Shredding documents prior to disposal
* shoulder Surfing
  * Social engineering trick to get someone to enter credentials into an application or website
    * Strike up a conversation about their kid's sports, then ask to see some photos
    * Shoulder surf as they enter their username/password into social media website
      * Mitigation

    * Interested party seeking employment
    * Angry customer filing complaint
  * Targeted phishing and spear phishing techniques aimed at "big fish" like company executives (i.e whaling)
    * Phishing, vishing and various social engineering techniques to gather information
    * Emails are targeted, very specific and seem legitimate
  * Mitigation
    * Security Awareness Training
      * Ensure employees know to never click links from sources they don't know
      * Don't open attachments from an unknown origin
    * Technical Controls
      * SPAM filtering 
      * Heuristics
      * Firewalls/Deep Packet Inspections
* Prepending
  * Adding mentions (@username) to tweets or social media posts to make them seem more personal
    * Higher engagement
    * Can be automated to become almost as efficient as manual spear-phishing campaigns
* Impersonation
  * Impersonation can be done via a number of methods:
  * Social engineering 
  * Stolen credentials/credential harvesting
  * Infiltrating a network and capturing and replaying packets on a network
* Identity Fraud
  * Malware, social engineering, and old-school methods (i.e. dumpster diving)

  * Pastebin and other paste sites
    * Paste sites allow hackers and bad actors to post large amount of comprised accounts and information, as well as access other breach information
* Watering Hole Attack
  * Sophisticated attack that identifies less secure websites users in a particular company or organization are likely to visit
    * Attackers plant malware on the sites users visit to then infect the targeted users - once they visit the infected site
    * Malicious code scans the users' computer for vulnerabilities, zero-days, etc.
      * May download additional code to initiate attacks, siphon data, etc.
* Typo Squatting/URL Hijacking

### Analyzing Malware and Other Attacks
* Indicator of Compromise (IOC)
  * Artifacts observed that indicate (with a high degree of confidence) a computer intrusion
    * Some Potential Indicators of Compromise
      * Unusual outbound network traffic
      * DNS request anomalies
      * Mismatch port-application traffic
      * Anomalies in privileged user account activity
