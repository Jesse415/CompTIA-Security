# Attacks, Threats, & Vulnerabilities for CompTIA Security+

### Comparing Different types of social engineering techniques
* A social engineer is someone who is a master of asking seemingly non-invasive questions to gather information over time
        
    * Gain trust to reduce defenses 
    * Can be combined with different techniques to gather information
    * Example: Calling customer service and acting like someone from corporate asking names of apps, or infrastructure, and/or buzz words. Then calling back and talking with said buzz words to pretend to be in the company to get more and more information. 
* Phishing
  * Obtaining sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card info)
  * Tricking a user into entering their info into a fake website
    * Email spoofing
    * Instant messaging

    * Adding random data to the hashing algorithm so that each users hash is unique even if both have the same password
      * Larger salts increase security
* Known Plain Text/ Ciphertext
  * Access to both the plain text and the encrypted output (ciphertext)
    * Tyhe attack can be used to reveal further information such as secret keys or code books used to encrypt subsequent messages
  * Mitigation - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher is not vulnerable to this type of attack
* Birthday Attack
  * Brute-force attack that works on the cryptographic phenomenon of hash collisions
    * Given enough time, two independent sources could yield the same hash
      * Rate of occurrence varies depending on hash algorithm
  * Birthday Paradox
    * In a room full of people, what is the probability that two will share the same birthday
      * 23 people = 50%
      * 30 people = 70%
      * 70 people = 99.9%
      * 253 people = 100%
  * Example:
    * If a users password is "p-1234ju" which equals the hash value of "2kj3g4i2g324" you can look for a password with the hash value of "2kj3g4i2g324" which the password could be "idontknowthepassword" and use that password to log in because the hash values equal
* Downgrade Attack
  * Attack that forces a system to negotiate down to a lower0quality method of communication

    * Dump the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) (local accounts file)
    * Retrieve /etc/passwd file
    * Look for insecure files shares
    * DLL pre-loading
    * Insecure or weak security on processes 
  * Many vulnerabilities enable an attacker to gain system-level permissions
* Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  * Techniques used to hijack sessions
    * Can be non-persistent (email, blog posts, etc)
    * Persistent (server based) where an attacker doesn't need to actively target a user
    * Non-Persistent
      * Specially crafted URL's sent in an e-mail, instant message, blog post, etc. 
    * DOM Based
      * Can be non-persistent and be used to hijack sessions, etc
    * Persistent
      * Server based and can execute on a victim's PC by visiting an infected site
  * Cross-Site Scripting via Email
    * User is sent an email containing a malicious link and is convinced to click on the link
    * The URL is sent to the legitimate site, along with malicious code which then executes in the victim's web browser
  * Cross-Site Scripting with Unauthorized Request
    * User is sent an email containing a malicious link and is convinced to click on the link
    * The URL is sent to the legitimate site, along with malicious code which then executes in the victim's web browser
    * The attacker could then issues additional requests to the legitimate server, post data to other parts of the site, etc.
* SQL Injection
  * SQL (Structured Query Language)
    * Modifying the SQL query that's passed to web application
    * SQL server, etc
  * Adding code into a data stream
    * bypass login screens
    * Vulnerable websites return usernames, passwords, wtc, with the right SQL injection
    * CAuse the application to "throw" an error and crash (allowing an attacker remote access)
* DLL Injection
  * DLL Injection is a process of inserting code into a running process
  * Four basic steps:
    * Attach to the process
    * Allocate Memory within the process memory and determine appropriate memory addresses
    * Instruct the process to Execute your DLL
  * DLL injection attacks can be created manually or pentesting tools like Metasploit can automate the process
* LDAP Injection
  * Light weight Directory Access Protocol
    * "Address Book" of user accounts used to authenticate users
    * Identifies level of access, group memberships, etc
  * Similar to SQL injection attacks in that the query that is passed to the web server is modified to include malicious query statements or code
* XML Injection
   ```
   # Form Input Example
   <input type="text" size=20 name="userName">Insert the username</input>

   # Underlying Code
   String ldapSearchQuery= "(cn=" + $userName + ")";
    System.out.println(ldapSearchQuery);

   # "crees) ( | (password = *) )"
   ```
  * Attack technique that manipulates the logic of an XML application or service
    * Could be used to inject XML into a statement that alters a path to a file to disclose sensitive information
    ```
    <?xml version"1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE results [<!ENTITY harmless SYSTEM
    "file:///var/www/config.ini">]>
    <results>
        <results>&harmless;</result>
    </results>
    ```
* Pointer Dereference
  * Vulnerability that can cause an application to throw an exception error, which typically results in the application crashing
    * Can be leveraged for a DoS attack against the entire system
    * Remote code execution
  * C/C++, Assembly or any other language that uses pointers is potentially vulnerable to this type of attack
* Directory Traversal / Command Injection
  * Attack that manipulates user input to cause the application to traverse a directory structure and access files not intended to 
* Buffer Overflow
  * Attack that causes a system or app to crash of behave unexpectedly
    * Writing more data than the buffer can handle
    * Data is written to adjacent memory
  * Calls or pointers to jump to a different address that what was intended
    * Can contain user executable code which could allow remote code execution
* Race Conditions
  * A race condition occurs when a pair of routine programming calls in an application do not perform in the sequential manner that was intended
    * Potential security vulnerability if the calls are not performed in the correct order
  * Potential Vulnerabilities
    * Authentication: Trust may be assigned to an entity who is not who it claims to be
    * Integrity: Data from an un-trusted (and possibly malicious) source may be integrated
    * Confidentiality: Data may be disclosed to an entity impersonating a trusted entity, resulting in information disclosure
* Time of Check
  * Type of race condition
    * Attacker is able to gain access prior to an authentication check
    * Inserts code or alters authentication to disrupt normal authentication processes 
    * Administrator see the intrusion, reset passwords, etc., but the attacker may still have access
      * Attacker could remain logged in with old credentials
  * Also referred to aas Time of Check to Time of Use (TOCTTOU)
* Secure Coding Concepts, Error Handling, and Input Validation
  * Application development is often a balancing act between time to market and security
    * Building for security adds to development time
      * Critical - If you don't have time to fine the vulnerabilities, the bad guys will
  * Error and exception handling
    * What does the application do when it encounters an error?
      * Does it continue running, restart a process or module, or completely crash?
    * If it crashes, does it give an attacker elevated privileges
      * Keys to the castle?
  * Input Validation
    * Validate/sanitize what is entered at the client side and/or server side before it's processed
    * Mitigate attacks such as Cross Site Scripting
    * SQL injections
  * References
    * OWASP 
    * CERT 
* Replay Attacks
  * Sniffing the wired or wireless network, a replay attack captures packets and puts them back on the wire
    * Packets can potentially be modified and retransmitted to look like legitimate packets
  * Mitigation - Sequencing helps mitigate the effectiveness of this type of attack
* Integer Overflow
  * Integer overflow condition occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum size of integer type used to store it
  * When the overflow occurs, the interpreted value appears to "wrap around" the max value and start at the min value
    * Could allow transactions to be reversed (i.e. money sent instead of received)
* Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF)

    * CSRF or "See-Surf"
  * Requires victim to have recently visited the target website and have a valid cookie (not expired)
  * XSS & XSRF Distinction
    * In a XSS attack, the browser runs malicious code because it was served from a site it trusts
    * In a XSRF attack, the server performs an action because it was sent a request from a client it trusts
* API Attacks
  * Hostile usage of an API
    * Injection attacks
    * DoD/DDos Attacks
    * Authentication hijacking

    * Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are examples of this type of attack
* Memory Leak
  * A memory leak is typically an unintentional consumption of memory. The application fails to release the memory once it's no longer needed
  * This consumption of resources can over time lead to a variety of issues:
    * Degraded system performance
    * Abnormal system behavior
    * System crashes
    * DoS
  * Threat actors can use those vulnerabilities to try and crash a system to gain elevated privileges or take a system offline via a Denial of Service attack
* SSL Stripping
  * MitM type of attack that strips away SSL encryption
    * Enables an attacker to intercept traffic between victim and target
    * Enterprise users, wired or Wi-Fi hotspots, etc.
  * Mitigation
    * Use SSL everywhere
      * Not just on pages that contain sensitive data
    * Use HSTS
      * HTTP strict Transport Security
      * Forces clients/browsers to connect over HTTPS 
* Shimming
  * Shim databases are part of Microsoft Window's Application Compatibility Infrastructure
    * Used to maintain compatibility with legacy applications
    * Can be used for malicious purposes by custom shim databases to install code, patches, etc.
* Refactoring
  * Modifying an application's source code without changing the underlying functionality
    * Purpose - Fix bugs, patch code and tighten up security without changing or adversely affecting the underlying functionality
* Pass the Hash
  * Harvesting a user's password hash to authenticate to a remote server or service
  * Normal operation
    1. User wants to access remote resource
    2. Server sends authentication challenge
    3. User enters their credentials (username/password)
    4. Password in converted to a has value
    5. Hash value is sent to the server
    6. Server checks the hash  value against the expected value
    7. Access is granted to resource (assuming hash values match)
  * Passing the Hash
    1. Hacker wants to access remote resource
    2. Server sends authentication challenge
    3. Hacker enters username and stolen hash value
    4. Hash value is sent to the server
    5. Server checks the hash value against the expected value
    6. Access is granted to resource (assuming hash values match)

### Identifying Network Attacks
* Rogue Access Points and Evil Twin
  * Unauthorized access point
    * Used to steal or intercept data
    * Can be combined with jamming/interference techniques
  * Installed in a corporate network bu unauthorized personnel
  * Installed by hackers for Man in The Middle attacks
  * Evil Twin
    * Rogue access point that is impersonating a legitimate access point - using the same SSID
* Bluejack and Bluesnarfing
  * Sending of unauthorized messages or data to a victim's device via Bluetooth technology
  * Sending a vCard which contains a message in the name field to another Bluetooth-enabled device via the OB-EX (OBject-EXchange) protocol
  * Bluesnarfing
    * is the opposite of blue-jacking, in that data is pulled off the victims device
      * Contact lists
      * Pictures
      * Messages
    * All sorts of sensitive information can be stolen
      * Pictures Text Messages
      * Emails

    * Active Reader/Passive Tag (ARPT)
    * Active Reader/Active Tag (ARAT)
  * Most commercial RFID for inventory control has an effective distance of ~3 ft.
* Near Field Communication (NFC)
  * Technology to allow communication between devices within close proximity to each other (usually 3-4")
    * Builds upon RFID (one-way) whereas NFC is two-way communication
    * Can be used by a malicious attacker to steal data from a nearby device
* IV Attack
  * Initialization Vector Attack
    * Weaker encryption had short IVs that would repeat fairly quickly
    * Attacker could flood the network, sniff the packets and see the IVs being sent
      * As they eventually repeat, the attacker could derive the IV and then gain access
  * WEP uses a 24-bit IV
    * Easily cracked
    * Since beed deprecated
* On-Path Attacks (Formerly MitB)
  * MAn in the Browser attack
    * The attacker send a malicious email or link and the Trojan gets installed on their machine
    * When a browser is launched - the code is then executed
    * Scans for known sites of attack
    * When banking sites are visited, the malware launches in the background
    * Executes commands/transactions, captures data, etc.
  * The user may see a loading screen thinking that the site is slow or something is wrong, meanwhile the scripts/commands are running, once finished the user gets sent to the actual site
* ARP Poisoning
  * Also known as ARP Cache Poisoning
    * Attacker sends out spoofed ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages onto a LAN to associate their machine with another host IP (i.e, default gateway) Layer 3 address down to the layer 1
    * Allows the attacker to intercept data intended for another recipient 
    * Can be used for DoS, MiTM, or session hijacking
* IP/MAC Spoofing
  * Masquerading as another using their IP or MAC address
    * IP address spoofing
    * Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing
      * ARP resolves an IP address to a MAC address
  * Can be used with MiTM attacks
* MAC Flooding (Media Access Control)
  * Network Switch will build a MAC table so that every computer connected to it will receive all its intended data
  * An attacker send a large number of ethernet frames while inside the network so that the server fills up the MAC table to the point that it forces out the MAC Address from the table so it sends all packets to all PC's can cause a DoS attack
  * This allows the attacker to see all the network traffic because the server doesn't know who to send packets to
* DNS Poisoning
  * Also known as "DNS Cache Poisoning"
    * Manipulating that data in a DNS server's cache to point to different IP address
    * Attack could redirect a site's traffic from the legitimate site to one they own
